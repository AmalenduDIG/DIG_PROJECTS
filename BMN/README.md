**BLACKMAGIC NETWORK**

BMN (BlackMagic Network) is a **DAO governed Gaming Metaverse Platform** powered by **$BMC (BlackMagic Coin).**

It is a one-stop shop where blockchain game enthusiasts can **buy NFTs, trade tokens, recruit scholars, participate in early launchpad token offerings** and enjoy the experience of play-to-earn games.

BMN, the mission is to revitalize the industry to provide our users with **innovative experiences** , in which users can **own and monetize their in-game assets.**

**Traditional gaming companies** are profit driven, focused on products revolved around microtransactions, loot boxes, and other methods.

BlackMagic Network is the Steam of **web3** , it&#39;s more than just a platform that incubates and helps **develop P2E and Play and Earn games** , It&#39;s is a common place in the Metaverse where Crypto and non-Crypto gamers can meet to enjoy **on-chain and off-chain** gaming experiences.

The **BMC token** was created to decentralize the management and development of BlackMagic Network&#39;s DAO, investments, products, and platform.

**$BMC is a cross-platform currency** (currently on Polygon) designed to be interoperable across the entire BMN ecosystem.

Owning even a **single BMC token** gives the holder a voice about the future of the DAO, whether it be a big or small decision, each stakeholder will have their own voice.

The **BlackMagic Network governance forum** will be a place where governance members can share their opinion by broadcasting proposals with the other members of the organization.

The governance structure will be implemented based on the battle-tested **OpenZeppelin&#39;s Governor contract.** We will use **Tally** as a full-fledged application for on-chain governance, which consists of a **voting dashboard, proposal wizard and real-time analysis.**

**BMN is more than just a DAO** , it is an ecosystem that is made up of our very own play-to-earn games, **a DEX aggregator, wallet and a launchpad platform.** Each part of the ecosystem represents sources of revenue for the DAO.

Our aim is for the native BlackMagic Network wallet to become the **go-to wallet for storing and swapping play-to-earn/metaverse tokens.**

BMN Chain is a **layer two (L2) scaling solution for non-fungible tokens** (NFTs) on Ethereum, with **instant trading, massive scalability and zero gas fees** for minting and trading, all without compromising user or asset security.

BMN Chain will be one of the most technically **advanced solutions for NFT scaling** ever built, developed with **StarkWare&#39;s powerful STARK prover and rollup technology.**

The BMC token is the native **ERC20 utility token of the BlackMagic Network** , which users can earn by conducting pro-network activities such as trading and which can be used to **pay fees, perform governance or stake on the protocol.**

The **Rewards Visa Card** , powered by the $BMC token, supports dozens of play-to-earn metaverse tokens. To avoid market fluctuations, the chosen crypto coin you&#39;d like to spend will be converted to **USD based on the real time market value** and then loaded to the **Rewards Visa. It can then be used like any other form of payment card.**

Another unique feature offered within the BlackMagic Network Ecosystem is the new and improved **Scholar Marketplace.**

As an Nft holder (Manager) you can **review Scholar statistics and lend your Nft to a Scholar** who you think is best suited to your asset. Any earnings are then shared between the Scholar and Nft holder.
