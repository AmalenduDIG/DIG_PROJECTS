**RoE (Realms of Ethernity)**

ROE is the next generation **free-to-play MMORPG** (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) experience.
A game which strives to **create decentralized player-driven communities** where you, the player, can form life-long relationships by embarking on epic adventures.

# **WHAT IS REALMS OF ETHERNITY?**

Imagine a World of Warcraft-inspired open world, now **built with blockchain technology** where **players can truly own their inventory** and **earn real cash** from their gaming experience… 
Inside Realms of Ethernity, **players can interact with the game** just like any other classic MMORPGs, e.g explore dungeons, **kill monsters for rewards or battle with other** players…
Nonetheless, we proudly introduce **the dual currency of in-game gold coins and the token named $RETH** that works to empower players to immerse themselves in the game and earn from their play!
The **open world of RoE brings to players a limitless possibilities** of things to do.

In the game, we integrate **a special set of quests and attributes called the &quot;Destiny&quot;** , acting as **a special game pass** to players who own it. 
**Special in-game assets as NFT are minted** along the way that bring advancements to players. They can be **crafted, bought or sold** on the marketplace.
Alongside their journey, **players can buy, build, expand their own kingdoms.
** Kingdom owners can **start wars to conquer other kingdoms and collect tax from all activities** within the owned lands.
Communities, as one of the **core traits that defines success of an MMO** , will be built and consolidated upon time. 
To enhance it, we introduce the **Bond feature, a way to co-work with other players to complete quests in a team** (such as killing bosses, mining, farming,...) and **split the rewards.**

The **RoE will be released in seasons** with a given premise for the very first season. 
The ultimate **ending of each season is expected to be a Kingdom or a Nation war**.
**How each season ends will be determined by players** , and this **very ending** will lead to the **start of the next season**.
By that, **players will be ones who write the next chapters for Realms of Ethernity!**
